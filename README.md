Users may use voice commands to request their VA to answer the questions, manage home appliances, control media playing, and handle other essential activities like email, creating the actions lists, and organize the meetings on calendars . In the Internet of Things (IoT) world, an VA is a popular service to communicate with users based on voice command.
